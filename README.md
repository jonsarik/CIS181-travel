CIS 181 Favorite Vacation Spot Website Project

I need to create a 4-page web site on a travel destination of my choosing as a class project. I chose Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The assignment requires, at a minimum the following:
- Main home page (1 page). This should include a short intro to the subject and perhaps a picture or two to get the visitor excited about the subject matter.
- Information (2 or more pages). Include information on the subject that you feel would be relevant to the user (history, resources, location, etc.).
- “About the Web Developer” (1 page). Should be a short 2-3 paragraph bio of yourself, including your name. Also mention what drew you to this particular vacation destination.

Some notable requirement:
- Easily readable style across all pages, implemented using a single external style sheet.
- Every page that uses images must properly and clearly credit the sources of the images.
- At least one page must include a table of some sort that is used for tabular data only.
- In keeping with SEO practices, every page should contain a descriptive title element, an h1 element, and an h2 element.
- Each page must include four or more of the following semantic HTML elements: main, header, footer, nav, aside, article, and section.
- At least one page must include an image file, and at least one page must include a list (this does not include the page’s navigation).
- Must change the default link and visited link states – no blue or purple underlined text!
- Pages must work in all browsers.
