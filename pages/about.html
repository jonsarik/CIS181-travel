                <p>My name is Jonathan Sarkarati, and I'm a returning student at Wilbur Wright College in Chicago. This is my first attempt at a website so don't judge too harshly!</p>
                <p>Pictured Rocks holds special meaning as this was my first road trip with my wife and daughter as a circle tour of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Raised in California I was privileged to have visited places from Yosemite to Zion National Park. Pictured Rocks returned that sense of awe of the natural splendor with the added bonus of lighthouses!</p>
